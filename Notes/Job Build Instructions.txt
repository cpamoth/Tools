Instructions on how to build a project:

Manual Process:
http://sourcecontrol/svn/Gis/Development/Interfaces/PostingListenerTestWS/Project%20Code

Get to the path of the project. Ex.(C:\SVN\Gis\Development\Core Applications\PrintLetterDriver\Project Code) 

Do a dir. Ex.(C:\SVN\Gis\Development\Core Applications\PrintLetterDriver\Project Code>dir)

Locate the proj file and open it in notepad++ and see what version you will be building for the project. Ex.(ToolsVersion="4.0)

Type in command msbuild + (project file name) and press enter. Ex.(C:\SVN\Gis\Development\Core Applications\PrintLetterDriver\Project Code>msbuild PrintLetterDriver.csproj)

The project will build now.

If the build succeeds, get the latest revision of the project and deploy the project. 

If the build fails, try and find out what parts of the project that you are missing and get the files on my box.

Run the build again once you have gotten the files you were missing.

Continue these steps above until the build succeeds.
